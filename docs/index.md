## No-Trump Openings
### 1NT opening
- Standard Stayman and Transfers: not in note.
- Weak stayman (*not Garbage Stayman*): 1NT- 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/2♠: Bad hand, shortness in clubs, willingness to play in any other suit.
- Garbage Stayman: Weak hand, 4-4 in majors or better. Would play *any major*
        - 1N-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-P
        - 1N-2♣-2♠-P
        - 1N-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (opener passes or corrects to 2♠)
- Both Majors (at least 5-4 or better)
   - With 5♠ and 4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> 
      - First bid 2♣ stayman, raise if opener bids either major.
      - After 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> response, 
          - bid 2♠ (inv), 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (GF) with Smolen
   - With 4♠ and 5<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, *it is a little different*
      - With GF hands, after Stayman
         - raise if opener bids either major
         - After 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> response, bid 3♠ (GF) with Smolen
      - With Invitational hands,
         - 1N-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> *does not work* (because this sequence would be Garbage Stayman)
         - 1N-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠, Transfer to <span style="color:red;">♥</span> and bid ♠.
   - With 5-5 in majors, Transfer to ♠ and then bid <span style="color:red;">♥</span> (GF)
         

- 1NT-2♠-? (range ask for ♣, bid with balanced invit hands)
     - 2N (15 pts)  
          -  pass with balanced invit
          -  correct to 3♣ with clubs
     - 3♣ (16/17 pts) 
         -  pass with weak clubs
         -  bid short suit with clubs and GF
         -  raise with 3N with balanced invit.
- 1NT-2N-? (range ask for <span style="color:red;">♦</span>)
     - 3♣ (15 pts)
         - 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> with diamonds
     - 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (16/17 pts) 
         - pass with weak diamonds
         - bid shortness with strong hand.

- 1NT-3♣ is a game forcing puppet (with 3 card minor, or 3-4 in majors)
    - 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> denies 5 card major, but can have 4
      -  follow-ups exactly like 2NT puppet
    - 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/3♠ shows 5 card major
    - 3NT denies 5 or 4 card majors.

- 1NT-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> ? Possible use, two suiters in minors
- 1NT-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> and 1NT-3♠, possible use: splinters with singleton

### 2NT opening

We use Stayman and transfers as usual, including texas. 
With 3 card majors,  bid 3♣ puppet Stayman (GF)

  - 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> denies 5 card major (has one 4cM)
      - 3NT (no 4cM)
      - 3♠/3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (4c oM)
  - 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/3♠: 5 cM
  - 3NT (no 5cM or 4cM)

## 1 of a suit openings

### 1M openings in 1st/2nd hand 
After a 1M opening we have  *indirect raises* going through the forcing  1NT or a 2/1 GF bid, and a host of different
direct raises. These are the example sequences for indirect raises

 - 1M-1NT-2♣-2M, Weak Raise, 5-7 HCP, 3+ card (indirect)
 - 1M-1NT-2♣-3M, Limit Raise, 10-12 HCP, 3 card (indirect)
 - 1M-2♣-2M-3/4 M,  (GF through a 2/1 GF bid)

The direct raises are

 - 1M-2M, Constructive Raise, 7-10 HCP. The increased point range allows easy invites and game tries.
 - 1M-3♣, Bergen, 4 cards, 7-10 HCP, constructive raise
 - 1M-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>, Bergen, 4 cards, 10-12 HCP, limit raise
 - 1M-2NT, [Jacoby 2NT](#jacoby-2nt), 4 cards, GF
 - 1M-3M, Preempt, <=6 HCP, 4 card support
 - 1M-4M, Preempt, <10 HCP, 5 cards, freaky hands
 - Splinters, double jump raise, GF


There are at least three different ways to GF with major suit support, we must 
assign different meanings to these sequences, esp with 4 card support. While we will decide the meanings later, these are the three different ways

- Jacoby 2NT, (4+ cards)
- 2/1 GF through another suit (3+ cards), and then followed by picture-jumps (later)
- Splinters, (shortness, 4 card support, limited)

A suggested solution is:

- Jacoby 2NT, no really good 2nd suit. With an excellent 5-card side suit go through 2/1, and then picture jump to show 4 card support or good trumps.
- Splinters, small point range, 12-15 HCP, other wise go through J2NT or 2/1 GF
- 2/1 bid--- use only if great 2nd suit, or no 4 card support


### 1M openings in the 3rd/4th hand

The main differences are 

  - We can open light, and rarely with 4 cards. 
  - Count *Cansino points*, Open if (HCP + number of ♠=15)  
  - No Bergen Raises. 1M-3♣ and 1M-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> are invitational hands with long minors.
  - 2♣, Drury, 3+ cards, 9-12 HCP 
  - 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>,  Drury 4+ cards.  9-12 HCP
  - 1NT can be 6-11 pts, but never with 3 card support for partner. Note the slightly increased point range because of the possibility of weakish openings. Those must go through Drury

### 1m  openings and raises

The present style involves flip-flop raises, and inverted minor raises as game forces. A different approach using only inverted minor raises as invtiational or better has been described by [Adam Parrish and Steve Weinstein](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/1m-2m-now-what/). Another promising relay based approach is advocated by [Eric Kokish](https://www.acblunit390.org/Simon/inverted-minors-kokish.htm)

The minor suit raise structure incorporates inverted Minor (GF) and criss-cross(INV) raises:

  - 1m-2m is 13+ points, GF (forcing to 4m). ♣ must have 5+ cards. <span style="color:red;">♦</span> can be raised with good 4.
  - 1m-3m is weak hands, <7 pts 
  - constructive raises, 8-9 points must go through 1NT, unfortunately.
  - 1♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>, 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3♣ (jump shift in other minor is a limit raise).
  - Minor suit raises deny 4 card major
  - 1m-1NT is natural
  - 1m-2NT is 11-12 points
  - 1m-3NT is 13-15 points with stoppers 
  - 1♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> is GF

Follow ups to 1m-2m : 

  - opener's 2 level rebids are stopper/suit showing.
  - opener's 2NT, shows major suit stoppers, at least
  - 1m -2m-2NT-?
     - 3m stopper ask
  - opners 3m - nothing else can be bid.
  - 1m-2m-2x-?
    - 2y, stoppers
    - 2NT, stoppers, 13-15 points
    - 3NT, stoppers, 15-17 points

Follow ups to 1♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> and 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3♣

  - opener is the captain, as responder has limited himself to 11-12 pts
  - 3m is a rejection of invit. 
  - 2NT (when available) is both majors
  - 3 of a suit is stopper asking (mostly from opener, and is at least forcing to 4m)
  

### When opponents double

After an 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/1♠ opening is doubled, we try to ignore it as much as possible:

- 2NT Jacoby 
- 3♣/3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Bergen Raise 
- 1NT: requires stopper and 6-10 (**not forcing**)
- Rdbl : 
   - Forcing NT with limit raise 
   - 2/1 GF bids without support
   - Real NT hands, 10+ pts 

### When opponents interfere with suit bid

 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(1♠/2♣/2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)-?   
or 1♠-(2♣/2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-?

- ~2NT ( 4+ cards limit raise)~
-  2NT: usual, 10-12 pts, with stopper
- Cuebid (3 cards limit raise)
- All other hands, X  

## Weak 2 openings
Exactly 6 cards with 6-11 pts(Not HCP) open 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/♠  

Responder bids(Ogust) :

- 2NT(GF either 15+HCP or min condition: *3 cards support with 14 HCP so that 14+3 = 17 THUMB rule adopted from Larry Cohen*, **Ogust**)
  - 3♣: one of the top three honor 6-8 pts
  - 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>: two of the top three honor 6-8 pts
  - 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>: one of the top three honor 9-11 pts
  - 3♠: two of the top three honor 9-11 pts
  - 3NT: three of the top three honor 9-11 pts
- 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/♠: If you have 3 card support and not interested in game. Law of total tricks. RONF (Raise only non forcing)
- 4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/♠: 4 cards fit

## 2/1 Continuations


### Nebulous and Schuler bids


Another desirable thing would be to have 2/1 suits be 5 cards. So we introduce another nebulous bid.

*Nebulous* 2♣ : Real 5+ clubs  and all other balanced hands without 5 card <span style="color:red;">♦</span>/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>.

One can design different follow ups, among them the simpler ones being the natural [Gumpertz](http://bridgewinners.com/article/view/better-21-bidding-the-nebulous-2c-bid/) and the artificial (but perhaps simpler) [Spear](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/spear-them/). For now, let us go with the first.

 1. Nebulous 2♣
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> shows 5+ diamonds
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> shows 5+ hearts
    - 1♠-2♣ *nebulous* : all other balanced GF hands or GF hands with real 5+ ♣ (all GF hands, basically)
 
 2. Responses to Nebulous 2♣ 
    - 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> : 4+ cards (std)
    - 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> : nebulous (waiting, all other hands) or real <span style="color:red;">♦</span> 
    - 1♠-2♣-2♠ : 6 card spades
    - 1♠-2♣-2NT : 18-19 pts or 12-14 NT goes through nebulous (promises stoppers)
    - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♣-2♠: no extras, 4 spades
    - Jumps to three level show shape from opener when possible:
       - 1♠-2♣-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>, splinter for <span style="color:red;">♦</span> with 4+ ♣, 5-1-2-4 or 5-0-3-5
       - 1♠-2♣-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, splinter for <span style="color:red;">♥</span> with 4+ ♣, 5-2-1-4 or 5-3-0-5
       - 1♠-2♣-3♣, 4 clubs, deny other features.
 
 3. Responses to the waiting 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>: 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-? Bidding is natural except 2oM showing real clubs.
    - 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>(other major) showing real clubs
    - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠(other major) showing real clubs
 4. Other shape showing continuations
    - 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>, 5-5 in spades and diamonds
    - 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-, 5 clubs and 4 diamonds, not much else to say.
    - When opener has 5-2-4-2 and responder has 2-3-4-4, the fit cannot be found early
 
 4. Schuler extensions: Openers cheapest suit can be nebulous, to distinguish between 5 and 6 card suits. (on trial)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>(4+ <span style="color:red;">♥</span>)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠(nebulous, balanced-ish)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT(6+ ♠)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠ (nebulous)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2NT (6 ♠, as in Schuler)
    - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (nebulous)
    - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT (6+ card, as in Schuler)

    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠ (nebulous)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT (6 ♠, as in Schuler)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠ (nebulous)
    - 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2NT (6 ♠, as in Schuler)
    - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (nebulous)
    - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT (6+ card, as in Schuler)
 
 
## XYZ Continuations
Perhaps it is useful to separate auctions XYNT and XYZ.

### 1m-1M-1NT
Let us consider bin reverse to the 4 or splinter for the 3 support happily, not showing extras. 5-4-2-2 can non-jump bid the 4 card suit at whatever level
  4. 1M-2d-2M is 6. The pdding after 1m-1M-1NT, where oM and om denote other major and other minor.

1m-1M-1NT-?

  -  2NT: Invitational, without 5 cards in M, or 4 in oM.
  -  2 ♣: Invitational with 5M or 4oM, or desire to quit in <span style="color:red;">♦</span>. It relays to 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> from the opener. follow-ups are 
        - 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-Pass, weak, signoff in <span style="color:red;">♦</span> 
        - 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2M, 5 cards in M. classic nmf situation.
        - 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2oM, 4 cards in other major.  
  - 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> : game forcing
      - 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2M opener's 3 card support 
      - 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2oM opener shows 4 cards in oM
      - 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3m good 5+ cards suit in minor.
      - 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT,  default response from opener.
- When no fit is found after the xyz relay, 3 level bids are stopper asking.
- **Advanced** : *Two or three important sequences still have to be assigned meaning*
    -  NT after relay. Since 1NT-2NT is still a valid bid. What is shown by 1m-1M-1NT-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT. This can be used as an additional relay. We will see about how to use it later.
   -  Direct 3m raise: 1m-1M-1NT-3m
   -  3m raise after relay 1m-1M-1NT-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3m
  
### 1x-1y-1z
Work under progress

## Agreements for strong game forcing auctions


### Jacoby 2NT  

Game forcing. 4 cards (extremely good 3 cards allowed).

We play Larry Cohen's [modified Jacoby 2NT](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/modified-jacoby-2nt/). 

We can use the mnemonic MSDLB (use your own mnemonic: my sound dolby)

1M-2NT-? 

  - M: 3♣ minimum 12-14 pts (responder relays to ask for shape, responses SDLB)
      - Relay (3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>) asks for shape of minimum hand
        - S: shortage, minimum
        - D: two doubletons 5-4-2-2 
        - L: 6 card suit (length),  6-3-2-2
        - B: 3N: proper balanced hands (18+, 15-17 opens 1N)
  - S: 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> shortage, 15+
       - Realy asks for shortage, answers in steps
         - V: void, followed by relay and LMH response 
         - L: lowest suit, ♣
         - M: middle  suit, <span style="color:red;">♦</span>
         - H: higher suit, other major
  - D: two doubletons 5-4-2-2, 15+
      - Relay aks for 2nd suit 
         - in steps, LMH (low middle high)
  - L: 6 card suit (length),  6-3-2-2, 15+
      - Relay aks for 2nd suit 
         - in steps, LMH
  - B: 3N: proper balanced hands (18+, 15-17 opens 1N)

### Two way splinters

Use [2-way splinters](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/slam-bidding-limiting-your-hand-with-a-splinter/) as limit bids, limits responders hand and shape precisely.

We don't splinter with a singleton Ace or King, to not mislead partner

#### Weak splinter (9-11 HCP)
- 1♠-3NT-? or 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-3♠-?  (**shows unspecified shortage**, don't reveal shape with weak hands)
   - Responder jumps to game with a weak hand or relays for information
   - Relay responses show shortage LMH

#### Strong splinters (11-14 HCP)
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span> -3NT  (shows spades)
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span> -4♣/4<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (shows ♣/<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)
  - 1♠ - 4♣/4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (shows ♣/<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)


### Picture Jumps

We follow Andrew Gumpertz's articles in the Bridge Winners ([Part 1](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/21-auctions-fast-arrival-vs-picture-bidding/), [Part 2](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/more-about-picture-jumps-and-fast-arrival/) and [Part 3](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/fast-arrival-and-picture-jumps-the-3nt-slam-try/)) in bridge winners. Another source is [Fred Gitelman](https://www.bridgebum.com/improving_two_over_one_auctions_part_1.php), who also covers Italian style cuebids, which we play.

The basic idea is that, in a 2/1 GF auction, the jump to 4 level is a picture jump, it  shows 3 things :

 1. good trumps (4 cards, or HHx)
 2. good, 5 card, second suit.
 3. *no outside controls*

Further, when a jump to the three level is available, it shows 

 1. good trumps (4 cards, or HHx)
 2. good, 5 card, second suit.
 3. *one or two outside controls*

Also use picture jumps in jump rebids of own suit, to show solid 1-loser suits.

Examples: 

-  1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠-? 
    - 4♠ : Picture Jump hand
    - 3♠ : all other game forcing hands with ♠ support
-  1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-? 
    - 4♠ : Picture Jump hand
    - 3♠ : all other game forcing hands with ♠ support
- 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>- ?
    - 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> : hearts support
    - 4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> : Picture jump in <span style="color:red;">♥</span>. 5 ♠, good  <span style="color:red;">♥</span> support, no outside controls


When all three bids are available. We use the 3-level bid as a picture jump which shows the outside controls that the 4 level bid denies :

 - Good trumps (4 cards or HHx)
 - Good 5 card second suit 
 - 1 or 2 outside controls.

- 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-?
   - 2♠ game force, 5 spades.
   - 3♠, strong Picture Jump (with outside controls)
   - 4♠, normal picture Jump.

Other Picture jumps

- 1♠-2♣-3♣-4♠ (again, ♣ and <span style="color:red;">♥</span>, no outside controls)
- 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (very good 5-4 in ♠ and <span style="color:red;">♥</span>, no outside controls)
- 1♠-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> ( very good 5-4 in ♣ and <span style="color:red;">♥</span>)


- Openers Rebids: 1♠-2♣-?
     - 3♠. Solid 1 loser suit, 1 or 2 outside controls (outside ♣ and ♠)
     - 4♠. Solid 1 loser suit, no outside controls.
     - 2♠ : all other.

Minor suit auctions    

-  For now, no picture jumps



### Frivolous 3NT

We play the frivolous/unserious 3NT as a slam try after a major suit has been agreed. This can be used after any game-forcing auction.
 
 1.  Cuebids showing controls become serious slam tries. 
 2.  Friv 3NT usually takes place when *no Picture Jump* as taken place. The idea being that after a Picture jump the partner of the picture-jumper can judge the contract and ask for Aces if need be

Examples: 

- 1♠-2♣-2♠ (no Picture Jump)- ?
    - 3NT Frivolous slam try --- partner to bid on with extras.
    - Cuebid : opener interested in slam, strong hand.
- 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (no Picture Jump)- ?
  - 3NT, unserious slam try
  - cuebid, serious slam try.



## General Competitive Auction agreements

### Freebids of new suits
 - after interference we play new suits as *Positive Freebids* (Strong, 10+ points, forcing) . The only exception is when opponents bid natural NT, then new suits are *negative freebids*.
 - after opponents X, we play new suits as *Negative Freebids* (Weak, 10- points, not forcing), with stronger hands we Rdbl first.

After an interference 

1. 2 level bids in new suits are 10+ points and show 5 cards (not 4).
2. 3 level bids in new suit GF. 

Examples :

1. 1♠-(2♣)-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (5 <span style="color:red;">♦</span>s, 10+ points).
2. 1♠-(2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-3♣ (5 ♣s, game forcing)
3. 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-(1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-1♠ (5 ♠s, 6+ points. With 4 ♠ s, bid Neg. X)
4. 1♣-(1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)-1♠/1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>( 4 cards, X shows 4-4 in majors)
5. 1♣-(1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-1♠( 5 cards, neg. X shows 4 ♠)

*Negative Freebids* (weak, <10 points) also show 5 cards. They are applicable after opponents double, or bid NT.  Examples :

1. 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(X)-1♠ (5♠s, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
1. 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(X)-2♣ (5♣s, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
2. (1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)-1♠-(P)-2♣ (*Positive Freebid*, 10+ points 5♣).
3. (1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)-1♠-1NT-2♣ (*negative Freebid*, <10 points, 5♣) 

### Two suiters

We are currently playing the Minimax Style: With 11-14 HCP open the higher suit.
Responder assumes the weaker hand. Opener must bid again with the stronger hand.
#### U2NT 

Shows 2 lowest unbid suits

- 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(2NT):<span style="color:red;">♦</span> and ♣   
- 1♠-(2NT):  <span style="color:red;">♦</span> and ♣   
- 1♣-(2NT) <span style="color:red;">♦</span> and <span style="color:red;">♥</span>   
- 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-(2NT) <span style="color:red;">♥</span> and ♣  


#### Extended Michaels
Highest and another Lower suit

- 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)- ♠ and minor  
- 1♠-(2♠)- <span style="color:red;">♥</span> and minor  
- 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-(2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)- ♠ and <span style="color:red;">♥</span>/<span style="color:red;">♦</span>  
- 1♣-(2♣)- ♠ and <span style="color:red;">♥</span>/<span style="color:red;">♦</span>

#### Leaping and non-leaping Michaels

Extend Michaels' philosophy to over calls of weak 2 and weak 3 bids


(2♠/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-?  
- 4♣/<span style="color:red;">♦</span>(jump bid): min 5-5 cards ♣/<span style="color:red;">♦</span> with <span style="color:red;">♥</span>/♠  
(2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)-?  

### Defence against 2 suiters
The basic philosophy is [Lower-Lower](http://kwbridge.com/bb/b_unus.htm). The same system can be used when our 1NT is interferred with 2-suited bids. But wecome back to it later   

**Both Suits are Known**

1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(2NT)-? :  
- Their Lower suit is a raise of our lower suit and vice versa:  
 - 3♣ shows limit raise or better in <span style="color:red;">♥</span>  
 - 3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> shows GF raise with 5+ ♠s
 - 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> preempt  
 - 3♠ 6+ cards, <10/11 pts  
 - 4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/ 4♣ splinter.

**Only 1 suit is known**

1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> showing ♠ and minor)-?  
- 2♠ : limit raise or better in hearts.   
- X : 10 + points no fit in openers suit

The idea here is to wait for opponents to find their second suit. After the opponents bid, the Xer rebids as follows :
- X : for penalty
- 3NT : game forcing, promises stoppers in known suits
- cuebid in any of the opponents suit: game forcing, stopper *asking*
- 3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>: hearts with preemptive quality, weaker than limit raise
- 4♣/4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/3♠: splinter type bids

## Lebensohls
### When Opponents interfere with our 1NT opening
This is the standard situation for Lebensohl,  almost all other situations "derive" from it.

When the opener's 1NT is interfered with.  1NT-(2♠)-? . The problem is that the responder has no space to show his possible range of hands, or whether he holds stoppers. Lebensohl creates extra space with the 2NT-3♣ relay. Depending on the interference and the responder's suit, the relay can create 3 levels of bids, or 2.  We are playing the *FASS* (Fast arrival shows stoppers) version, or *slow denies, fast shows* version, which contrasts the more popular *slow shows* version.


*Example with 3 levels*, weak, invit and GF

- 1NT-(2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-2♠ (5/6 ♠, want to sign off)
- 1NT-(2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-2NT-3♣-3♠ (5/6 ♠, invitational )
- 1NT-(2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>)-3♠ (5/6 ♠ game forcing)

*Example with 2 levels, no invitational sequence*:

- 1NT-(2♠)-2NT-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, want to sign off)
- 1NT-(2♠)-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, game force)

*Stronger Hands, stopper showing (slow denies, fast shows)*

- 1NT-(2♠)-3NT (game force, ♠ stopper FASS)
- 1NT-(2♠)-2NT-3♣-3NT (game force, no ♠ stopper, FASS)

*Other Major, "Stayman in the other major"*

- 1NT-(2♠)-3♠ (game force, 4<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, ♠ stopper, FASS)
- 1NT-(2♠)-2NT-3♣-3♠ (game force, no ♠ stopper, FASS)

*Good-Bad Lebenshol, Scrambling*
This section tries to summarise Robson-Segal

-  *Generally*, 2NT is Lebensohl in response to a t/o double. It is *always* so when RHO bids after t/o.
-  If enemy has bib 2♠ / 2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, parter makes a t/o double, and RHO passes, then it is *scrambling* in the following situations 
    1. auctions in which partner has balanced
    2. When responder to t/o had one chance to bid Lebensohl, but did not.
- In all competitive non-fit auctions where opener's 3nd bid is over 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>/2♠ by RHO, *unless* responder made  a forcing 2-leve bid, then 2NT is nat.





### When partner doubles their weak TWO

This situation is similar to the case after 1NT, but after a takeout double the partner *must* always bid, and *PASS* is not available. So when only 2 levels of bids are available, the direct 3 level bid is **not GF**, but often only invitational. For GF bids, one must either use 3NT or the cuebid-Stayman.

*Examples when 3 levels of bids are available*

- 2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(x)-2♠ (weak)
- 2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(x)-2NT-3♣-3♠ (invit)
- 2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-(x)- 3♠ (GF)

*Examples when 2 levels of bids are available* 

- 2♠-2NT-3♣-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (weak, could be 0 points, instead of invit)
- 2♠-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (invit, 8/9+, instead of GF)

The cuebid-stayman and 3NT bids are game-forcing, as after 1NT, employing FASS as usual

### After a simple reverse
Simple reverse: 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>     

-  2NT( Lebensohl), weak. < 8 pts, relay to 3♣ 
    -  Any other bid (disobeying the relay) shows GF from the opener
- Any other bid by the responder is 1RF. 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠ usually shows 6 ♠, opener cannot pass. 3 level bids (instead of Leb 2NT) are GF

## Strong 2 ♣ opening
- Standard 2♣, 22+ points or 9-ish tricks
- There are  **only two non-forcing** sequences:
    1. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT (shows 22-23/24 pts) 
    2. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> is a bust, 3- points, 4+ hands go through 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>.
    3. Responder bids cheapest new suit at 3 level called a *second negative*
          1. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠-3♣ (2nd neg)-3♠
          2. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>(2nd neg)-4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>
          3. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠-3♣-3♠-4♣ (responder rebids 2nd neg. suit to say he has real ♣)

 [Kokish Relay](https://www.bridgewebs.com/nkbc/Kokish.pdf) (KR) 

 Like all relays, it creates space. The usual pattern of Kokish Relay is 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠, with the 2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠ known as the Kokish relay

- Balanced  Hands
   1. Strong Balanced hand: 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠-2NT (24/25+ pts)
   2. Weak Balanced hand:  2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT (22-23/24 pts)
- Real hearts
   1. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (6 hearts single suiter)
   2. with 5-3-3-2 and 5 hearts, bid NT (as usual)
- Two suiters with hearts
   1. 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠-3♣ (double suiter, hearts and ♣, 5-4 or better)
- Two suiters with spades (later)
- Unassigned sequence: 2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (without relay)

## Opponents don't play standard systems
### Precision 2♣ opening
> Treat as **natural**.

## SOS redouble
> This is essential to rescue from penalty dbl.  

Consider the following,  
(1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>)-2♣-(Pass)-Pass  
(Dbl)-Pass-(Pass*)-?  
(*) Making the Dbl to penalty.  
And you have the hand ♠ Q8543<span style="color:red;">♥</span>Kj954♣3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>54, would you pass at this situation?  
**No!** You should ***Rdbl*** to tell the partner bid any ***unbid*** suit.   

**Two conditions should be followed to use SOS Rdbl.**  
- Support at least 4-4 cards in unbid suit.  
- Lack of support partner's suit.   
- SOS Rdbl is up to 3 levels!

1. We can find some examples in [bridgebum](https://www.bridgebum.com/sos_redouble.php).  
2. (Write whatever you like from the "considerations" section of Bridgebum)  
## Run after opponents double 1NT
### Moscow Escapes
If opponents dbl after your(partner) 1NT as penalty(i.e, 15+ HCP), I hardly have 10 HCP. So, we have only (1) transfer(most frequent) or (2) stayman(no so frequent). 

1NT-(X)-?  
- Pass, to play  
- XX, single suiter, opener bids 2♣  
- 2♣, ♣ and higher  
- 2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>, <span style="color:red;">♦</span> and higher  
- 2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, <span style="color:red;">♥</span> and ♠  
- 2♠, 5+ ♠s weaker than XX  

## Rules of thumb
### Rule of 20
> Guideline for opening bid less than 12 HCP.
Count the total HCP and then add the total number of cards of longest suits, if the value is equal to or more than 20 then open at 1 level.

### Restricted play
