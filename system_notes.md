# 2/1 Continuations
## Standard sequences
1!s-2!c-2!s :  5 cards  
1!s-2!c-2!d/2!h:  4 !d/!h   
1!s-2!c-2NT: 12-14 pts or 18-19 pts (rebid later), guarantees balanced. stoppers desirable  
~~Alternative:  ***Schuler Shift***: 2NT shows 6 !s~~

## Picture-bid sequences
We should follow Andrew Gumpertz's articles in the Bridge Winners ([Part 1](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/21-auctions-fast-arrival-vs-picture-bidding/), [Part 2](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/more-about-picture-jumps-and-fast-arrival/) and [Part 3](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/fast-arrival-and-picture-jumps-the-3nt-slam-try/)) in bridge winners. Another source is [Fred Gitelman](https://www.bridgebum.com/improving_two_over_one_auctions_part_1.php), who also covers Italian style cuebids, which we play.

The basic idea is that, in a 2/1 GF auction, the jump to 4 level is a picture jump, it  shows 3 things :
 1. good trumps (4 cards, or HHx)
 2. good, 5 card, second suit.
 3. *no outside controls*

Examples: 

**When only 3-level and 4-level raises are avialble**
-  1!s-2!d-2!s-? 
    - 4!s : Picture Jump hand
    - 3!s : all other game forcing hands with !s support
-  1!s-2!d-3!d-? 
    - 4!s : Picture Jump hand
    - 3!s : all other game forcing hands with !s support
- 1!s-2!h- ?
    - 3!h : hearts support
    - 4!h : Picture jump in !h. 5 !s, good  !h support, no outside controls

**When 2, 3 and 4-level bids are available**

When all three bids are available. We use the 3-level bid as a picture jump which shows the outside controls that the 4 level bid denies :
 - Good trumps (4 cards or HHx)
 - Good 5 card second suit 
 - 1 or 2 outside controls.

- 1!s-2!c-2!d-?
   - 2!s game force, 5 spades.
   - 3!s, strong Picture Jump (with outside controls)
   - 4!s, normal picture Jump.
- Openers Rebids: 1!s-2!c-?
     - 3!s. Solid 1 loser suit, 1 or 2 outside controls (outside !c and !s)
     - 4!s. Solid 1 loser suit, no outside controls.
     - 2!s : all other.

**To add**: Minor suit auctions    

 **Frivolous 3NT**
 
 1.  After a *major suit* is agreed upon, and the responder *does not picture jump* bid 3NT as an obligatory (unserious) slam try
  2.   Cuebids showing controls become serious slam tries. 
3.  Friv 3NT usually takes place when *no Picture Jump* as taken place

Examples: 

- 1!s-2!c-2!s (no Picture Jump)- ?
    - 3NT Frivolous slam try --- partner to bid on with extras.
    - Cuebid : opener interested in slam, strong hand.
- 1!s-2!h-3!h (no Picture Jump)- ?
  - 3NT, unserious slam try
  - cuebid, serious slam try.

# XYZ Continuations
Perhaps it is useful to separate auctions XYNT and XYZ.

### 1m-1M-1NT
Let us consider bidding after 1m-1M-1NT, where oM and om denote other major and other minor.

1m-1M-1NT-?
  -  2NT: Invitational, without 5 cards in M, or 4 in oM.
  -  2 !c: Invitational with 5M or 4oM, or desire to quit in !d. Relays to 2!d from opener. follow ups are 
        - 2!c-2!d-Pass, weak, signoff in !d 
        - 2!c-2!d-2M, 5 cards in M. classic nmf situation.
        - 2!c-2!d-2oM, 4 cards in other major.  
  - 2!d : game forcing
      - 2!d-2M opener's 3 card support 
      - 2!d-2oM opener shows 4 cards in oM
      - 2!d-3m good 5+ cards suit in minor.
      - 2!d-2NT,  default response from opener.
- When no fit is found after the xyz relay, 3 level bids are stopper asking.
- **Advanced** : *Two or three important sequences still have to be assigned meaning*
    -  NT after relay. Since 1NT-2NT is still a valid bid. What is shown by 1m-1M-1NT-2!c-2!d-2NT. This can be used as an additional relay. We will see about how to use it later.
   -  Direct 3m raise: 1m-1M-1NT-3m
   -  3m raise after relay 1m-1M-1NT-2!c-2!d-3m
  
## 1x-1y-1z
Work under progress



# Jacoby 2NT  
1M - 2NT: Shows **GF** hand with ***min 4 cards support or 3 cards having two of top three honors***.  
1M-2NT-?  
- 3(!c/!d/oM): shows void or singleton in that suit. Re-biding that suit at 4 level ensures void 
- 3M: Interest in slam
- 3NT: balanced hand, 12-14 HCP
- 4(!c/!d/oM): 5 cards  
>Note :
1. You cannot bid 1!h-2NT-4!s to show 5 cards !s because we cannot stop at 4!h level!  
2. The priority of bids: 
- First show the 5 cards other suit.
- Second show the short suit.  

After the opener bid any bid by the responder is **control bids** and 4NT is RKCB.



# General Competitive Auction agreements

## Freebids of new suits
 - after interference we play new suits as *Positive Freebids* (Strong, 10+ points, forcing) . The only exception is when opponents bid natural NT, then new suits are *negative freebids*.
 - after opponents X, we play new suits as *Negative Freebids* (Weak, 10- points, not forcing), with stronger hands we Rdbl first.

After an interference 

1. 2 level bids in new suits are 10+ points and show 5 cards (not 4).
2. 3 level bids in new suit GF. 

Examples :
1. 1!s-(2!c)-2!d (5 !ds, 10+ points).
2. 1!s-(2!h)-3!c (5 !cs, game forcing)
3. 1!d-(1!h)-1!s (5 !ss, 6+ points. With 4 !s s, bid Neg. X)
4. 1!c-(1!d)-1!s/1!h( 4 cards, X shows 4-4 in majors)
5. 1!c-(1!h)-1!s( 5 cards, neg. X shows 4 !s)

*Negative Freebids* (weak, <10 points) also show 5 cards. They are applicable after opponents double, or bid NT.  Examples :

1. 1!h-(X)-1!s (5!s, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
1. 1!h-(X)-2!c (5!s, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
2. (1!d)-1!s-(P)-2!c (*Positive Freebid*, 10+ points 5!c).
3. (1!d)-1!s-1NT-2!c (*negative Freebid*, <10 points, 5!c) 

## Two suiter

We are currently playing the ***Minimax Style***: With 11-15 HCP open the **higher** suit.
Responder assumes the weaker hand. Opener must bid again with the stronger hand.
### U2NT 
***Shows 2 lowest unbid suits***

1!h-(2NT):!d and !c   
1!s-(2NT):  !d and !c   
1!c-(2NT) !d and !h   
1!d-(2NT) !h and !c  


### Extended Michaels
***Highest and another Lower suit***     

1!h-(2!h)- !s and minor  
1!s-(2!s)- !h and minor  
1!d-(2!d)- !s and !h/!d  
1!c-(2!c)- !s and !h/!d

### Leaping and non-leaping Michaels

Extend Michaels' philosophy to over calls of weak 2 and weak 3 bids


(2!s/!h)-?  
- 4!c/!d(jump bid): min 5-5 cards !c/!d with !h/!s  
(2!d)-?  

## Defence against 2 suiters
The basic philosophy is [Lower-Lower](http://kwbridge.com/bb/b_unus.htm). The same system can be used when our 1NT is interferred with 2-suited bids. But wecome back to it later   

**Both Suits are Known**

1!h-(2NT)-? :  
- Their Lower suit is a raise of our lower suit and vice versa:  
 - 3!c shows limit raise or better in !h  
 - 3!d shows GF raise with 5+ !ss
 - 3!h preempt  
 - 3!s 6+ cards, <10/11 pts  
 - 4!d/ 4!c splinter.

**Only 1 suit is known**

1!h-(2!h showing !s and minor)-?
- 2!s : limit raise or better in hearts.   
- X : 10 + points no fit in openers suit
     The idea here is to wait for opponents to find their second suit. After the opponents bid, the Xer rebids as follows :
    - X : for penalty
   - 3NT : game forcing, promises stoppers in known suits
   - cuebid in any of the opponents suit: game forcing, stopper *asking*
- 3!h: hearts with preemptive quality, weaker than limit raise
- 4!c/4!d/3!s: splinter type bids

# Lebensohls
## When Opponents interfere with our 1NT opening
This is the standard situation for Lebensohl,  almost all other situations "derive" from it.

When the opener's 1NT is interfered with.  1NT-(2!s)-? . The problem is that the responder has no space to show his possible range of hands, or whether he holds stoppers. Lebensohl creates extra space with the 2NT-3!c relay. Depending on the interference and the responder's suit, the relay can create 3 levels of bids, or 2.  We are playing the *FASS* (Fast arrival shows stoppers) version, or *slow denies, fast shows* version, which contrasts the more popular *slow shows* version.


*Example with 3 levels*, weak, invit and GF
- 1NT-(2!h)-2!s (5/6 !s, want to sign off)
- 1NT-(2!h)-2NT-3!c-3!s (5/6 !s, invitational )
- 1NT-(2!h)-3!s (5/6 !s game forcing)

*Example with 2 levels, no invitational sequence*:
- 1NT-(2!s)-2NT-3!h (!h, want to sign off)
- 1NT-(2!s)-3!h (!h, game force)

*Stronger Hands, stopper showing (slow denies, fast shows)*
- 1NT-(2!s)-3NT (game force, !s stopper fast shows)
- 1NT-(2!s)-2NT-3!c-3NT (game force, no !s stopper, slow denies)

*Other Major, "Stayman in the other major"*
- 1NT-(2!s)-3!s (game force, 4!h, !s stopper, fast shows)
- 1NT-(2!s)-2NT-3!c-3!s (game force, no !s stopper, slow denies)





## When partner doubles their weak TWO

This situation is similar to the case after 1NT, but after a takeout double the partner *must* always bid, and *PASS* is not available. So when only 2 levels of bids are available, the direct 3 level bid is **not GF**, but often only invitational. For GF bids, one must either use 3NT or the cuebid-Stayman.

*Examples when 3 levels of bids are available*
- 2!h-(x)-2!s (weak)
- 2!h-(x)-2NT-3!c-3!s (invit)
- 2!h-(x)- 3!s (GF)

*Examples when 2 levels of bids are available* 
- 2!s-2NT-3!c-3!d (weak, could be 0 points, instead of invit)
- 2!s-3!d (invit, 8/9+, instead of GF)

The cuebid-stayman and 3NT bids are game-forcing, as after 1NT, employing FASS as usual

## After a simple reverse
Simple reverse: 1!d-1!s-2!h     
-  2NT( Lebensohl), weak. < 8 pts, relay to 3!c 
    -  Any other bid (disobeying the relay) shows GF from the opener
- Any other bid by the responder is 1RF. 1!d-1!s-2!h-2!s usually shows 6 !s, opener cannot pass. 3 level bids (instead of Leb 2NT) are GF

# Strong 2Club opening
- Standard 2!c, 22+ points or 9-ish tricks
- There are  **only two non-forcing** sequences:
    1. 2!c-2!d-2NT (shows 22-23/24 pts) 
    2. Responder bids cheapest new suit at 3 level called a *second negative*
          1. 2!c-2!d-2!s-3!c (2nd neg)-3!s
          2. 2!c-2!d-3!d-3!h(2nd neg)-4!d
          3. 2!c-2!d-2!s-3!c-3!s-4!c (responder rebids 2nd neg. suit to say he has real !c)

 ### [Kokish Relay](https://www.bridgewebs.com/nkbc/Kokish.pdf) (KR) 

 Like all relays, it creates space. The usual pattern of Kokish Relay is 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s, with the 2!h-2!s known as the Kokish relay

- Balanced  Hands
   1. Strong Balanced hand: 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s-2NT (24/25+ pts)
   2. Weak Balanced hand:  2!c-2!d-2NT (22-23/24 pts)
- Real hearts
   1. 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s-3!h (6 hearts single suiter)
   2. with 5-3-3-2 and 5 hearts, bid NT (as usual)
- Two suiters with hearts
   1. 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s-3!c (double suiter, hearts and !c, 5-4 or better)
- Two suiters with spades (later)
- Unassigned sequence: 2!c-2!d-3!h (without relay)

# SOS redouble
> This is essential to rescue from penalty dbl.  

Consider the following,  
(1!d)-2!c-(Pass)-Pass  
(Dbl)-Pass-(Pass*)-?  
(*) Making the Dbl to penalty.  
And you have the hand !s Q8543!hKj954!c3!d54, would you pass at this situation?  
**No!** You should ***Rdbl*** to tell the partner bid any ***unbid*** suit.  

> Two conditions should be followed to use SOS Rdbl.
* Support at least 4-4 cards in unbid suit.
* Lack of support partner's suit.  
* SOS Rdbl is up to 3 levels!
1. We can find some examples in [bridgebum](https://www.bridgebum.com/sos_redouble.php).
2. (Write whatever you like from the "considerations" section of Bridgebum)
# Run after opponents double 1NT
## Moscow Escapes
> If opponents dbl after your(partner) 1NT as penalty(i.e, 15+ HCP), I hardly have 10 HCP. So, we have only (1) transfer(most frequent) or (2) stayman(no so frequent). 
1NT-(X)-?
  - Pass, to play
  - XX, single suiter, opener bids 2!c
  - 2!c, !c and higher
  - 2!d, !d and higher
  - 2!h, !h and !s
  - 2!s, 5+ spades

# Rules of thumb
## Rule of 20
> Guideline for opening bid less than 12 HCP.
Count the total HCP and then add the total number of cards of longest suits, if the value is equal to or more than 20 then open at 1 level.

## Restricted play
