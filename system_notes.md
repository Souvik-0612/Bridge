## No-Trump Openings
### 1NT opening
- Standard Stayman and Transfers: not in note.
- Weak Stayman (*not Garbage Stayman*): 1NT- 2!c-2!d/2!h/2!s: Bad hand, shortness in clubs, willingness to play in any other suit.
- Garbage Stayman: Weak hand, 4-4 in majors or better. Would play *any major*
        - 1N-2!c-2!h-P
        - 1N-2!c-2!s-P
        - 1N-2!c-2!d-2!h (opener passes or corrects to 2!s)
- Both Majors (at least 5-4 or better)
   - With 5!s and 4!h 
      - First bid 2!c stayman, raise if opener bids either major.
      - After 2!d response, 
          - bid 2!s (inv), 3!h (GF) with Smolen
   - With 4!s and 5!h, *it is a little different*
      - With GF hands, after Stayman
         - raise if opener bids either major
         - After 2!d response, bid 3!s (GF) with Smolen
      - With Invitational hands,
         - 1N-2!c-2!d-2!h *does not work* (because this sequence would be Garbage Stayman)
         - 1N-2!d-2!h-2!s, Transfer to !h and bid !s.
   - With 5-5 in majors, Transfer to !s and then bid !h (GF)

- 1NT-2!s-? (range ask for !c, bid with balanced invit hands)
     - 2N (15 pts)  
          -  pass with balanced invit
          -  correct to 3!c with clubs
     - 3!c (16/17 pts) 
         -  pass with weak clubs
         -  bid short suit with clubs and GF
         -  raise with 3N with balanced invit.
- 1NT-2N-? (range ask for !d)
     - 3!c (15 pts)
         - 3!d with diamonds
     - 3!d (16/17 pts) 
         - pass with weak diamonds
         - bid shortness with strong hand.

- 1NT-3!c is a game forcing puppet (with 3 card minor, or 3-4 in majors)
    - 3!d denies 5 card major, but can have 4
      -  follow-ups exactly like 2NT puppet
    - 3!h/3!s shows 5 card major
    - 3NT denies 5 or 4 card majors.

- 1NT-3!d two suiters in minors
- Remember after a transfer sequence 1NT-(2M-1)-2M, responders bid of 4M is always a *mild slam try*. Without slam interest he makes a *Texas* transfer.
- 1NT-3!h and 1NT-3!s, possible use: splinters with exactly 1=3=(5=4) or 3=1=(5=4)
- 1NT-2!c-2M-3!s 

### 2NT opening

We use Stayman and transfers as usual, including texas. 
With 3 card majors,  bid 3!c puppet Stayman (GF)

  - 3!d denies 5 card major (has one 4cM)
      - 3NT (no 4cM)
      - 3!s/3!h (4c oM)
  - 3!h/3!s: 5 cM
  - 3NT (no 5cM or 4cM)

## 1 of a suit openings

### 1M openings in 1st/2nd hand 
After a 1M opening we have  *indirect raises* going through the forcing  1NT or a 2/1 GF bid, and a host of different
direct raises. These are the example sequences for indirect raises

 - 1M-1NT-2!c-2M, Weak Raise, 5-7 HCP, 3+ card (indirect)
 - 1M-1NT-2!c-3M, Limit Raise, 10-12 HCP, 3 card (indirect)
 - 1M-2!c-2M-3/4 M,  (GF through a 2/1 GF bid)

The direct raises are

 - 1M-2M, Constructive Raise, 8-10 HCP. The increased point range allows easy invites and game tries.
 - 1M-3!c, Bergen, 4 cards, 7-10 HCP, constructive raise
 - 1M-3!d, Bergen, 4 cards, 10-12 HCP, limit raise
 - 1M-2NT, [Jacoby 2NT](#jacoby-2nt), 4 cards, GF
 - 1M-3M, Preempt, <=6 HCP, 4 card support
 - 1M-4M, Preempt, <10 HCP, 5 cards, freaky hands
 - Splinters, double jump raise, GF


There are at least three different ways to GF with major suit support, we must 
assign different meanings to these sequences, esp with 4 card support. While we will decide the meanings later, these are the three different ways

- Jacoby 2NT, (4+ cards)
- 2/1 GF through another suit (3+ cards), and then followed by picture-jumps (later)
- Splinters, (shortness, 4 card support-- we play 2 kinds of splinters now-- roughly 9-11 and 12-14 hcp)

A suggested solution is:

- Jacoby 2NT, no really good 2nd suit. With an excellent 5-card side suit go through 2/1, and then picture jump to show 4 card support or good trumps.
- Splinters, small point range, 12-15 HCP, other wise go through J2NT or 2/1 GF
- 2/1 bid--- use only if great 2nd suit, or no 4 card support


### 1M openings in the 3rd/4th hand

The main differences are 

  - We can open light, and rarely with 4 cards. 
  - Count *Cansino points*, Open if (HCP + number of !s=15)  
  - No Bergen Raises. 1M-3!c and 1M-3!d are invitational hands with long minors.
  - 2!c, Drury, 3+ cards, 9-11 HCP 
  - 2!d,  Drury 4+ cards.  9-11 HCP
  - 1NT can be 6-11 pts, but never with 3 card support for partner. Note the slightly increased point range because of the possibility of weakish openings. 

### 1m  openings and raises

The present style involves flip-flop raises, and inverted minor raises as game forces. A different approach using only inverted minor raises as invtiational or better has been described by [Adam Parrish and Steve Weinstein](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/1m-2m-now-what/). Another promising relay based approach is advocated by [Eric Kokish](https://www.acblunit390.org/Simon/inverted-minors-kokish.htm)

The minor suit raise structure incorporates inverted Minor (GF) and criss-cross(INV) raises:

  - 1m-2m is 13+ points, GF (forcing to 4m). !c must have 5+ cards. !d can be raised with good 4.
  - 1m-3m is weak hands, <7 pts 
  - constructive raises, 8-9 points must go through 1NT, unfortunately.
  - 1!c-2!d, 1!d-3!c (jump shift in other minor is a limit raise).
  - Minor suit raises deny 4 card major
  - 1m-1NT is natural
  - 1m-2NT is 11-12 points
  - 1m-3NT is 13-15 points with stoppers 
  - 1!c-2!d is GF

Follow ups to 1m-2m : 

  - opener's 2 level rebids are stopper/suit showing.
  - opener's 2NT, shows major suit stoppers, at least
  - 1m -2m-2NT-?
     - 3m stopper ask
  - opners 3m - nothing else can be bid.
  - 1m-2m-2x-?
    - 2y, stoppers
    - 2NT, stoppers, 13-15 points
    - 3NT, stoppers, 15-17 points

Follow ups to 1!c-2!d and 1!d-3!c

  - opener is the captain, as responder has limited himself to 11-12 pts
  - 3m is a rejection of invit. 
  - 2NT (when available) is both majors
  - 3 of a suit is stopper asking (mostly from opener, and is at least forcing to 4m)
  

### When opponents double

After an 1!h/1!s opening is doubled, we try to ignore it as much as possible:

- 2NT Jacoby 
- 3!c/3!d Bergen Raise 
- 1NT: requires stopper and 6-10 (**not forcing**)
- Rdbl : 
   - Forcing NT with limit raise 
   - 2/1 GF bids without support
   - Real NT hands, 10+ pts 

### When opponents interfere with suit bid

 1!h-(1!s/2!c/2!d)-?   
or 1!s-(2!c/2!d/2!h)-?

- ~2NT ( 4+ cards limit raise)~
-  2NT: usual, 10-12 pts, with stopper
- Cuebid (3 cards limit raise)
- All other hands, X  

## Weak 2 openings
Exactly 6 cards with 6-11 pts(Not HCP) open 2!d/!h/!s  

Responder bids(Ogust) :

- 2NT(GF either 15+HCP or min condition: *3 cards support with 14 HCP so that 14+3 = 17 THUMB rule adopted from Larry Cohen*, **Ogust**)
  - 3!c: one of the top three honor 6-8 pts
  - 3!d: two of the top three honor 6-8 pts
  - 3!h: one of the top three honor 9-11 pts
  - 3!s: two of the top three honor 9-11 pts
  - 3NT: three of the top three honor 9-11 pts
- 3!d/!h/!s: If you have 3 card support and not interested in game. Law of total tricks. RONF (Raise only non forcing)
- 4!d/!h/!s: 4 cards fit

## 2/1 Continuations


### Nebulous 2!c


Another desirable thing would be to have 2/1 suits be 5 cards. So we introduce another nebulous bid.

*Nebulous* 2!c : Real 5+ clubs  and all other balanced hands without 5 card !d/!h.

One can design different follow ups, among them the simpler ones being the natural [Gumpertz](http://bridgewinners.com/article/view/better-21-bidding-the-nebulous-2c-bid/) and the artificial (but perhaps simpler) [Spear](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/spear-them/). For now, let us go with the first.

 1. Nebulous 2!c
    - 1!s-2!d shows 5+ diamonds
    - 1!s-2!h shows 5+ hearts
    - 1!s-2!c *nebulous* : all other balanced GF hands or GF hands with real 5+ !c (all GF hands, basically)
 
 2. Responses to Nebulous 2!c 
    - 1!s-2!c-2!h : 4+ cards (std)
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d : nebulous (waiting, all other hands) or real !d 
    - 1!s-2!c-2!s : 6 card spades
    - 1!s-2!c-2NT : 18-19 pts or 12-14 NT goes through nebulous (promises stoppers)
    - 1!h-2!c-2!s: no extras, 4 spades
    - Jumps to three level show shape from opener when possible:
       - 1!s-2!c-3!d, splinter for !d with 4+ !c, 5-1-2-4 or 5-0-3-5
       - 1!s-2!c-3!h, splinter for !h with 4+ !c, 5-2-1-4 or 5-3-0-5
       - 1!s-2!c-3!c, 4 clubs, deny other features.
 
 3. Responses to the waiting 2!d: 1!s-2!c-2!d-? Bidding is natural except 2oM showing real clubs.
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d-2!h(other major) showing real clubs
    - 1!h-2!c-2!d-2!s(other major) showing real clubs
 4. Other shape showing continuations
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d-2NT-3!d, 5-5 in spades and diamonds
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d-3!d-, 5 clubs and 4 diamonds, not much else to say.
    - When opener has 5-2-4-2 and responder has 2-3-4-4, the fit cannot be found early
 5. No reverses after 2/1
 6. reverse to the 4 or splinter for the 3 support happily, not showing extras. 5-4-2-2 can non-jump bid the 4 card suit at whatever level
 7. 1M-2d-2M is 6. The bidding after 1m-1M-1NT, where oM and om denote other major and other minor.
 
 
## XYZ Continuations
The key changes are ( *tldr: all invites thru 2!c-2!d relay. 1x-1y-1z-2NT is Lebenshol-> 3!c. Direct 3 level jumps are 5-5 GF*)

   1. All invitational sequences go through 2!c, except the sequence 1m-1!h-1NT-2!s which shows invitational with 4-4 in MM, whereas 1m-1!h-1NT-2!c-2!d-2!s would show 5-4 in !h and !s.

   2. A direct bid of '2NT' after xyz is always a relay to 3!c--- it is a sort of Lebensohl. This either wants to sign off in clubs, or wants to show clubs and show shortness (check a stopper) on the way to 3NT.

   3. Balanced hands wanting to invite to NT game must go through the 2!c-2!d relay (2NT is Lebensohl)

   4. Jump bids into the three level like 1m-1!h-1NT-3!d shows GF with good 5-5 in suits. This is no longer an invitation, as invites go through 2!c-2!d.

   5. In XYNT auctions, one partner has limited itself, so bidding 2NT or 3M instead of game shows slam interest. Whereas in XYZ auctions, partner can bid 3M or 2NT with nothing to say, and slam tries can go through unserious 3NT or cuebids.

### Invitational and sign-off sequences 
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!c-2!d-2!h-? inv with 5 !h
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!c-2!d-3!h-? inv with semi-solid 6 !h
  - 1!c-1!s-1NT-2!c-2!d-2!h-? inv with  5-4 in !s-!h
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!c-2!d-2!s-? inv with 5-4 in !h-!s
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!s-? inv with 4-4 in !h-!s
  - 1!c-1M-1NT-2!c-2!d-2NT-? inv balanced.
  - 1!c-1M-1NT-2!c-2!d-3!d-? inv with 5-5 in M and !c. We want 5-5 for 3 level bids
  - 1!c-1M-1NT-2!c-2!d-3!c-? inv with 4-5 in M and !c. 
  - 1!c-1M-2NT-3!c-p signoff in clubs 
### GF sequences 
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!d-2!h-4!h, usual GF looking for 5-3 fit
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!d-2!h-3NT, wants to suggest playing 3NT with 5-3 fit, perhaps at Matchpoints. After opener has limited his hand, 3NT does not shows extras. Opener can invite slam with 4NT if he so wishes

  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!d-2!h-2NT possible slam interest or GF but wants to play in minor
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!d-2!h-3!c shows 5 hearts and 4+ clubs (relay shows 5 hearts)
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2NT-3!c-3NT shows 4 hearts and 4 clubs
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!d-2!h-2!s shows 4-4 or 5-4 in majors.
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2!d-2!h-3!h very good hand with hearts (possibly slam interested, since partner has already limited himself). 
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-3!h shows a better solid (1 loser) suit than this.
  - 1c -1!h-1NT-2!d-2!d-3!h, 5 hearts, 4+ diamonds, GF. (bad suit if 5-5)
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2NT-3!c-3X, 4!h, 5+!c, singleton in X
  - 1!c-1!h-1NT-2NT-3!c-3NT, 4!h, 5+!c, no shortness


  
### 1x-1y-1z
Work under progress

## Agreements for strong game forcing auctions


### Jacoby 2NT  

Game forcing. 4 cards (extremely good 3 cards allowed).

We play Larry Cohen's [modified Jacoby 2NT](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/modified-jacoby-2nt/). 

We can use the mnemonic MSDLB (use your own mnemonic: my sound dolby)

1M-2NT-? 

  - M: 3!c minimum 12-14 pts (responder relays to ask for shape, responses SDLB)
      - Relay (3!d) asks for shape of minimum hand
        - S: shortage, minimum
        - D: two doubletons 5-4-2-2 
        - L: 6 card suit (length),  6-3-2-2
        - B: 3N: proper balanced hands (18+, 15-17 opens 1N)
  - S: 3!d shortage, 15+
       - Realy asks for shortage, answers in steps
         - V: void, followed by relay and LMH response 
         - L: lowest suit, !c
         - M: middle  suit, !d
         - H: higher suit, other major
  - D: two doubletons 5-4-2-2, 15+
      - Relay aks for 2nd suit 
         - in steps, LMH (low middle high)
  - L: 6 card suit (length),  6-3-2-2, 15+
      - Relay aks for 2nd suit 
         - in steps, LMH
  - B: 3N: proper balanced hands (18+, 15-17 opens 1N)

### Two way splinters

Use [2-way splinters](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/slam-bidding-limiting-your-hand-with-a-splinter/) as limit bids, limits responders hand and shape precisely.

We don't splinter with a singleton Ace or King, to not mislead partner

#### Weak splinter (9-11 HCP)
- 1!s-3NT-? or 1!h-3!s-?  (**shows unspecified shortage**, don't reveal shape with weak hands)
   - Responder jumps to game with a weak hand or relays for information
   - Relay responses show shortage LMH

#### Strong splinters (11-14 HCP)
  - 1!h -3NT  (shows spades)
  - 1!h -4!c/4!d (shows !c/!d)
  - 1!s - 4!c/4!d/4!h (shows !c/!d/!h)


### Picture Jumps

We follow Andrew Gumpertz's articles in the Bridge Winners ([Part 1](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/21-auctions-fast-arrival-vs-picture-bidding/), [Part 2](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/more-about-picture-jumps-and-fast-arrival/) and [Part 3](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/fast-arrival-and-picture-jumps-the-3nt-slam-try/)) in bridge winners. Another source is [Fred Gitelman](https://www.bridgebum.com/improving_two_over_one_auctions_part_1.php), who also covers Italian style cuebids, which we play.

The basic idea is that, in a 2/1 GF auction, the jump to 4 level is a picture jump, it  shows 3 things :

 1. good trumps (4 cards, or HHx)
 2. good, 5 card, second suit.
 3. *no outside controls*

Further, when a jump to the three level is available, it shows 

 1. good trumps (4 cards, or HHx)
 2. good, 5 card, second suit.
 3. *one or two outside controls*

Also use picture jumps in jump rebids of own suit, to show solid 1-loser suits.

Examples: 

-  1!s-2!d-2!s-? 
    - 4!s : Picture Jump hand
    - 3!s : all other game forcing hands with !s support
-  1!s-2!d-3!d-? 
    - 4!s : Picture Jump hand
    - 3!s : all other game forcing hands with !s support
- 1!s-2!h- ?
    - 3!h : hearts support
    - 4!h : Picture jump in !h. 5 !s, good  !h support, no outside controls


When all three bids are available. We use the 3-level bid as a picture jump which shows the outside controls that the 4 level bid denies :

 - Good trumps (4 cards or HHx)
 - Good 5 card second suit 
 - 1 or 2 outside controls.

- 1!s-2!c-2!d-?
   - 2!s game force, 5 spades.
   - 3!s, strong Picture Jump (with outside controls)
   - 4!s, normal picture Jump.

Other Picture jumps

- 1!s-2!c-3!c-4!s (again, !c and !h, no outside controls)
- 1!s-2!h-4!h (very good 5-4 in !s and !h, no outside controls)
- 1!s-2!c-2!h-4!h ( very good 5-4 in !c and !h)


- Openers Rebids: 1!s-2!c-?
     - 3!s. Solid 1 loser suit, 1 or 2 outside controls (outside !c and !s)
     - 4!s. Solid 1 loser suit, no outside controls.
     - 2!s : all other.

Minor suit auctions    

-  For now, no picture jumps



### Frivolous 3NT

We play the frivolous/unserious 3NT as a slam try after a major suit has been agreed. This can be used after any game-forcing auction.
 
 1.  Cuebids showing controls become serious slam tries. 
 2.  Friv 3NT usually takes place when *no Picture Jump* as taken place. The idea being that after a Picture jump the partner of the picture-jumper can judge the contract and ask for Aces if need be

Examples: 

- 1!s-2!c-2!s (no Picture Jump)- ?
    - 3NT Frivolous slam try --- partner to bid on with extras.
    - Cuebid : opener interested in slam, strong hand.
- 1!s-2!h-3!h (no Picture Jump)- ?
  - 3NT, unserious slam try
  - cuebid, serious slam try.



## General Competitive Auction agreements

### Freebids of new suits
 - after interference we play new suits as *Positive Freebids* (Strong, 10+ points, forcing) . The only exception is when opponents bid natural NT, then new suits are *negative freebids*.
 - after opponents X, we play new suits as *Negative Freebids* (Weak, 10- points, not forcing), with stronger hands we Rdbl first.

After an interference 

1. 2 level bids in new suits are 10+ points and show 5 cards (not 4).
2. 3 level bids in new suit GF. 

Examples :

1. 1!s-(2!c)-2!d (5 !ds, 10+ points).
2. 1!s-(2!h)-3!c (5 !cs, game forcing)
3. 1!d-(1!h)-1!s (5 !ss, 6+ points. With 4 !s s, bid Neg. X)
4. 1!c-(1!d)-1!s/1!h( 4 cards, X shows 4-4 in majors)
5. 1!c-(1!h)-1!s( 5 cards, neg. X shows 4 !s)

*Negative Freebids* (weak, <10 points) also show 5 cards. They are applicable after opponents double, or bid NT.  Examples :

1. 1!h-(X)-1!s (5!ss, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
1. 1!h-(X)-2!c (5!cs, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
2. (1!d)-1!s-(P)-2!c (*Positive Freebid*, 10+ points 5!c).
3. (1!d)-1!s-1NT-2!c (*negative Freebid*, <10 points, 5!c) 

### Two suiters

We are currently playing the Minimax Style: With 11-14 HCP open the higher suit.
Responder assumes the weaker hand. Opener must bid again with the stronger hand.
#### U2NT 

Shows 2 lowest unbid suits

- 1!h-(2NT):!d and !c   
- 1!s-(2NT):  !d and !c   
- 1!c-(2NT) !d and !h   
- 1!d-(2NT) !h and !c  


#### Extended Michaels
Highest and another Lower suit

- 1!h-(2!h)- !s and minor  
- 1!s-(2!s)- !h and minor  
- 1!d-(2!d)- !s and !h/!d  
- 1!c-(2!c)- !s and !h/!d

#### Leaping and non-leaping Michaels

Extend Michaels' philosophy to over calls of weak 2 and weak 3 bids


(2!s/!h)-?  
- 4!c/!d(jump bid): min 5-5 cards !c/!d with !h/!s  
(2!d)-?  

### Defence against 2 suiters
The basic philosophy is [Lower-Lower](http://kwbridge.com/bb/b_unus.htm). The same system can be used when our 1NT is interferred with 2-suited bids. But wecome back to it later   

**Both Suits are Known**

1!h-(2NT)-? :  
- Their Lower suit is a raise of our lower suit and vice versa:  
 - 3!c shows limit raise or better in !h  
 - 3!d shows GF raise with 5+ !ss
 - 3!h preempt  
 - 3!s 6+ cards, <10/11 pts  
 - 4!d/ 4!c splinter.

**Only 1 suit is known**

1!h-(2!h showing !s and minor)-?  
- 2!s : limit raise or better in hearts.   
- X : 10 + points no fit in openers suit

The idea here is to wait for opponents to find their second suit. After the opponents bid, the Xer rebids as follows :
- X : for penalty
- 3NT : game forcing, promises stoppers in known suits
- cuebid in any of the opponents suit: game forcing, stopper *asking*
- 3!h: hearts with preemptive quality, weaker than limit raise
- 4!c/4!d/3!s: splinter type bids

## Lebensohls
### When Opponents interfere with our 1NT opening
This is the standard situation for Lebensohl,  almost all other situations "derive" from it.

When the opener's 1NT is interfered with.  1NT-(2!s)-? . The problem is that the responder has no space to show his possible range of hands, or whether he holds stoppers. Lebensohl creates extra space with the 2NT-3!c relay. Depending on the interference and the responder's suit, the relay can create 3 levels of bids, or 2.  We are playing the *FASS* (Fast arrival shows stoppers) version, or *slow denies, fast shows* version, which contrasts the more popular *slow shows* version.


*Example with 3 levels*, weak, invit and GF

- 1NT-(2!h)-2!s (5/6 !s, want to sign off)
- 1NT-(2!h)-2NT-3!c-3!s (5/6 !s, invitational )
- 1NT-(2!h)-3!s (5/6 !s game forcing)

*Example with 2 levels, no invitational sequence*:

- 1NT-(2!s)-2NT-3!h (!h, want to sign off)
- 1NT-(2!s)-3!h (!h, game force)

*Stronger Hands, stopper showing (slow denies, fast shows)*

- 1NT-(2!s)-3NT (game force, !s stopper FASS)
- 1NT-(2!s)-2NT-3!c-3NT (game force, no !s stopper, FASS)

*Other Major, "Stayman in the other major"*

- 1NT-(2!s)-3!s (game force, 4!h, !s stopper, FASS)
- 1NT-(2!s)-2NT-3!c-3!s (game force, no !s stopper, FASS)




### When partner doubles their weak-2

This situation is similar to the case after 1NT, but after a takeout double the partner *must* always bid, and *PASS* is not available. So when only 2 levels of bids are available, the direct 3 level bid is **not GF**, but often only invitational. For GF bids, one must either use 3NT or the cuebid-Stayman.

*Examples when 3 levels of bids are available*

- 2!h-(x)-2!s (weak)
- 2!h-(x)-2NT-3!c-3!s (invit)
- 2!h-(x)- 3!s (GF)

*Examples when 2 levels of bids are available* 

- 2!s-2NT-3!c-3!d (weak, could be 0 points, instead of invit)
- 2!s-3!d (invit, 8/9+, instead of GF)

The cuebid-stayman and 3NT bids are game-forcing, as after 1NT, employing FASS as usual

### After a simple reverse
Simple reverse: 1!d-1!s-2!h     

-  2NT( Lebensohl), weak. < 8 pts, relay to 3!c 
    -  Any other bid (disobeying the relay) shows GF from the opener
- Any other bid by the responder is 1RF. 1!d-1!s-2!h-2!s usually shows 6 !s, opener cannot pass. 3 level bids (instead of Leb 2NT) are GF

## Strong 2 !c opening
- Standard 2!c, 22+ points or 9-ish tricks
- There are  **only two non-forcing** sequences:
    1. 2!c-2!d-2NT (shows 22-23/24 pts) 
    2. 2!c-2!h is a bust, 3- points, 4+ hands go through 2!d.
    3. Responder bids cheapest new suit at 3 level called a *second negative*
          1. 2!c-2!d-2!s-3!c (2nd neg)-3!s
          2. 2!c-2!d-3!d-3!h(2nd neg)-4!d
          3. 2!c-2!d-2!s-3!c-3!s-4!c (responder rebids 2nd neg. suit to say he has real !c)

### Other competitive auctions, (Good-bad etc)
This section tries to summarise the Robson-Segal book

-  *Generally*, 2NT is Lebensohl in response to a t/o double. It is *always* so when RHO bids after t/o.
-  If enemy has bid 2!s / 2!h, partner makes a t/o double, and RHO passes, then it is *scrambling* in the following situations 
    1. auctions in which partner has bid in the balancing position.
    2. When responder to t/o had one chance to bid Lebensohl, but did not.
- In all competitive non-fit auctions where opener's 2NT bid is over 2!d/2!h/2!s by RHO, *unless* responder made  a forcing 2-level bid, then 2NT is nat.



## [Kokish Relay](https://www.bridgewebs.com/nkbc/Kokish.pdf) (KR) 

 Like all relays, it creates space. The usual pattern of Kokish Relay is 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s, with the 2!h-2!s known as the Kokish relay

- Balanced  Hands
   1. Strong Balanced hand: 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s-2NT (24/25+ pts)
   2. Weak Balanced hand:  2!c-2!d-2NT (22-23/24 pts)
- Real hearts
   1. 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s-3!h (6 hearts single suiter)
   2. with 5-3-3-2 and 5 hearts, bid NT (as usual)
- Two suiters with hearts
   1. 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s-3!c (double suiter, hearts and !c, 5-4 or better)
- Two suiters with spades go through 2!s relay(2!c -2!d-2!s-2NT-3!c)
- Unassigned sequence: 2!c-2!d-3!h (without relay)

## Defence against special systems

### Defence of precision 1!c(16+) opening
- 1NT for both minors
- X for both majors
- Rest are natural.

### Defence of 2!d(weak in major)
- ACBL defence 1
  - Double is a takeout in hearts 
  - 2!h is a takeout in spades
  - Everything else natural
  - 3x shows 6+ hearts and good points.


## Slam Bidding Agreements
Presently we play RKC 1430 with King Ask showing specific kings. 
The keycard ask is kickback style. 
4T+1 is always keycards for T.

Future Improvements:
  - Exclusion Keycard
  - Standard void showing responses.
## Scoring techniques matter!

## SOS redouble
> This is essential to rescue from penalty dbl.  

Consider the following,  
(1!d)-2!c-(Pass)-Pass  
(Dbl)-Pass-(Pass*)-?  
(*) Making the Dbl to penalty.  
And you have the hand !s Q8543!hKj954!c3!d54, would you pass at this situation?  
**No!** You should ***Rdbl*** to tell the partner bid any ***unbid*** suit.   

**Two conditions should be followed to use SOS Rdbl.**  
- Support at least 4-4 cards in unbid suit.  
- Lack of support partner's suit.   
- SOS Rdbl is up to 3 levels!

1. We can find some examples in [bridgebum](https://www.bridgebum.com/sos_redouble.php).  
2. (Write whatever you like from the "considerations" section of Bridgebum)  

## Rules of thumb
### Rule of 20
Guideline for opening bid less than 12 HCP.
Count the total HCP and then add the total number of cards of longest suits, if the value is equal to or more than 20 then open at 1 level.
### Rule of 7
When your partner makes a bid over a preempt, he is always making a wish of sorts. He is wishing that you have something. About seven points is the traditional guideline of what he is allowed to wish for.
