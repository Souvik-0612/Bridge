# Bridge system note

## No-Trump Openings

### 1NT opening

* With 4-4 Stayman
* With 5-5 in majors, Transfer to ♠ and then bid ♥ (GF)
* With 5-4 in majors
  * First bid 2♣ stayman, raise if supported.
  * After 2♦ response,
    * bid 2♠ (inv), 3♥ (GF) with Smolen
* With 4-5 in majors
  * inv: transfer to ♥ and bid 2♠
  * GF: Stayman, and bid 3♥ after 2♦ response
* 1NT-2♠-? (range ask for ♣, bid with balanced invit hands)
  * 2N (15 pts)
    * pass with balanced invit
    * correct to 3♣ with clubs
  * 3♣ (16/17 pts)
    * pass with weak clubs
    * bid short suit with clubs and GF
    * raise with 3N with balanced invit.
* 1NT-2N-? (range ask for ♦)
  * 3♣ (15 pts)
    * 3♦ with diamonds
  * 3♦ (16/17 pts)
    * pass with weak diamonds
    * bid shortness with strong hand.

We also have some unassigned bids

* 1NT-3♣-? Possible use as a game forcing Puppet hand with a 3cM, looking for a 5-3 fit in a major with opener.
* 1NT-3♦ ? Possible use, two suiters in minors
* 1NT-3♥ and 1NT-3♠, possible use: splinters

### 2NT opening

We use Stayman and transfers as usual, including texas. With 3 card minors, bid 3♣ puppet Stayman (GF)

* 3♦ denies 5 card major (has one 4cM)
  * 3NT (no 4cM)
  * 3♠/3♥ (4c oM)
* 3♥/3♠: 5 cM
* 3NT (no 5cM or 4cM)

### 1 of a suit openings

#### 1M openings in 1st/2nd hand

After a 1M opening we have _indirect raises_ going through the forcing 1NT or a 2/1 GF bid, and a host of different direct raises. These are the example sequences for indirect raises

* 1M-1NT-2♣-2M, Weak Raise, 5-7 HCP, 3+ card (indirect)
* 1M-1NT-2♣-3M, Limit Raise, 10-12 HCP, 3 card (indirect)
* 1M-2♣-2M-3/4 M, (GF through a 2/1 GF bid)

The direct raises are

* 1M-2M, Constructive Raise, 7-10 HCP. The increased point range allows easy invites and game tries.
* 1M-3♣, Bergen, 4 cards, 7-10 HCP, constructive raise
* 1M-3♦, Bergen, 4 cards, 10-12 HCP, limit raise
* 1M-2NT, [Jacoby 2NT](./#jacoby-2nt), 4 cards, GF
* 1M-3M, Preempt, <=6 HCP, 4 card support
* 1M-4M, Preempt, <10 HCP, 5 cards, freaky hands
* Splinters, double jump raise, GF

There are at least three different ways to GF with major suit support, we must assign different meanings to these sequences, esp with 4 card support. While we will decide the meanings later, these are the three different ways

* Jacoby 2NT, (4+ cards)
* 2/1 GF through another suit (3+ cards), and then followed by picture-jumps (later)
* Splinters, (shortness, 4 card support, undefined point range)

A suggested solution is:

* Jacoby 2NT, no really guide 2nd suit. With an excellent 5-card side suit go through 2/1, and then picture jump to show 4 card support or good trumps.
* Splinters, small point range, 12-15 HCP, other wise go through J2NT or 2/1 GF
* 2/1 bid--- use only if great 2nd suit, or no 4 card support

#### 1M openings in the 3rd/4th hand

The main differences are

* We can open light, and rarely with 4 cards.
* Count _Cansino points_, Open if (HCP + number of ♠=15)
* No Bergen Raises. 1M-3♣ and 1M-3♦ are invitational hands with long minors.
* 2♣, Drury, 3+ cards, 9-12 HCP
* 2♦, Drury 4+ cards. 9-12 HCP
* 1NT can be 6-11 pts, but never with 3 card support for partner. Those must go through Drury

#### When opponents double

After an 1♥/1♠ opening is doubled, we try to ignore it as much as possible:

* 2NT Jacoby
* 3♣/3♦ Bergen Raise
* 1NT: requires stopper and 6-10 (_**not forcing**_)
* Rdbl:
  * Forcing NT with limit raise
  * 2/1 GF bids without support
  * Real NT hands, 10+ pts

#### When opponents interfere with suit bid

1♥-(1♠/2♣/2♦)-?\
or 1♠-(2♣/2♦/2♥)-?

* ~~2NT ( 4+ cards limit raise)~~
* 2NT: usual, 10-12 pts, with stopper
* Cuebid (3 cards limit raise)
* All other hands, X

### Weak 2 openings

Exactly 6 cards with 6-11 pts(Not HCP) open 2♦/♥/♠

Responder bids(Ogust) :

* 2NT(GF either 15+HCP or min condition: _3 cards support with 14 HCP so that 14+3 = 17 THUMB rule adopted from Larry Cohen_, **Ogust**)
  * 3♣: one of the top three honor 6-8 pts
  * 3♦: two of the top three honor 6-8 pts
  * 3♥: one of the top three honor 9-11 pts
  * 3♠: two of the top three honor 9-11 pts
  * 3NT: three of the top three honor 9-11 pts
* 3♦/♥/♠: If you have 3 card support and not interested in game. Law of total tricks. RONF (Raise only non forcing)
* 4♦/♥/♠: 4 cards fit

### 2/1 Continuations

#### Standard sequences

1♠-2♣-2♠ : 5 cards\
1♠-2♣-2♦/2♥: 4 ♦/♥\
1♠-2♣-2NT: 12-14 pts or 18-19 pts (rebid later), guarantees balanced. stoppers desirable\
~~Alternative: _**Schuler Shift**_: 2NT shows 6 ♠~~

#### Picture-bid sequences

We should follow Andrew Gumpertz's articles in the Bridge Winners ([Part 1](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/21-auctions-fast-arrival-vs-picture-bidding/), [Part 2](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/more-about-picture-jumps-and-fast-arrival/) and [Part 3](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/fast-arrival-and-picture-jumps-the-3nt-slam-try/)) in bridge winners. Another source is [Fred Gitelman](https://www.bridgebum.com/improving\_two\_over\_one\_auctions\_part\_1.php), who also covers Italian style cuebids, which we play.

The basic idea is that, in a 2/1 GF auction, the jump to 4 level is a picture jump, it shows 3 things :

1. good trumps (4 cards, or HHx)
2. good, 5 card, second suit.
3. _no outside controls_

Examples:

**When only 3-level and 4-level raises are avialble**

* 1♠-2♦-2♠-?
  * 4♠ : Picture Jump hand
  * 3♠ : all other game forcing hands with ♠ support
* 1♠-2♦-3♦-?
  * 4♠ : Picture Jump hand
  * 3♠ : all other game forcing hands with ♠ support
* 1♠-2♥- ?
  * 3♥ : hearts support
  * 4♥ : Picture jump in ♥. 5 ♠, good ♥ support, no outside controls

**When 2, 3 and 4-level bids are available**

When all three bids are available. We use the 3-level bid as a picture jump which shows the outside controls that the 4 level bid denies :

* Good trumps (4 cards or HHx)
* Good 5 card second suit
* 1 or 2 outside controls.
* 1♠-2♣-2♦-?
  * 2♠ game force, 5 spades.
  * 3♠, strong Picture Jump (with outside controls)
  * 4♠, normal picture Jump.
* Openers Rebids: 1♠-2♣-?
  * 3♠. Solid 1 loser suit, 1 or 2 outside controls (outside ♣ and ♠)
  * 4♠. Solid 1 loser suit, no outside controls.
  * 2♠ : all other.

**To add**: Minor suit auctions

**Frivolous 3NT**

1. After a _major suit_ is agreed upon, and the responder _does not picture jump_ bid 3NT as an obligatory (unserious) slam try
2. Cuebids showing controls become serious slam tries.
3. Friv 3NT usually takes place when _no Picture Jump_ as taken place

Examples:

* 1♠-2♣-2♠ (no Picture Jump)- ?
  * 3NT Frivolous slam try --- partner to bid on with extras.
  * Cuebid : opener interested in slam, strong hand.
* 1♠-2♥-3♥ (no Picture Jump)- ?
  * 3NT, unserious slam try
  * cuebid, serious slam try.

### XYZ Continuations

Perhaps it is useful to separate auctions XYNT and XYZ.

#### 1m-1M-1NT

Let us consider bidding after 1m-1M-1NT, where oM and om denote other major and other minor.

1m-1M-1NT-?

* 2NT: Invitational, without 5 cards in M, or 4 in oM.
* 2 ♣: Invitational with 5M or 4oM, or desire to quit in ♦. It relays to 2♦ from the opener. follow-ups are
  * 2♣-2♦-Pass, weak, signoff in ♦
  * 2♣-2♦-2M, 5 cards in M. classic nmf situation.
  * 2♣-2♦-2oM, 4 cards in other major.
* 2♦ : game forcing
  * 2♦-2M opener's 3 card support
  * 2♦-2oM opener shows 4 cards in oM
  * 2♦-3m good 5+ cards suit in minor.
  * 2♦-2NT, default response from opener.
* When no fit is found after the xyz relay, 3 level bids are stopper asking.
* **Advanced** : _Two or three important sequences still have to be assigned meaning_
  * NT after relay. Since 1NT-2NT is still a valid bid. What is shown by 1m-1M-1NT-2♣-2♦-2NT. This can be used as an additional relay. We will see about how to use it later.
  * Direct 3m raise: 1m-1M-1NT-3m
  * 3m raise after relay 1m-1M-1NT-2♣-2♦-3m

#### 1x-1y-1z

Work under progress

### Jacoby 2NT

1M - 2NT: Shows **GF** hand with _**min 4 cards support or 3 cards having two of top three honors**_.\
1M-2NT-?

* 3(♣/♦/oM): shows void or singleton in that suit. Re-biding that suit at 4 level ensures void
* 3M: Interest in slam
* 3NT: balanced hand, 12-14 HCP
* 4(♣/♦/oM): 5 cards

Note :

1. You cannot bid 1♥-2NT-4♠ to show 5 cards ♠ because we cannot stop at 4♥ level!
2. The priority of bids:

* First show the 5 cards other suit.
* Second show the short suit.

After the opener bid any bid by the responder is **control bids** and 4NT is RKCB.

### General Competitive Auction agreements

#### Freebids of new suits

* after interference we play new suits as _Positive Freebids_ (Strong, 10+ points, forcing) . The only exception is when opponents bid natural NT, then new suits are _negative freebids_.
* after opponents X, we play new suits as _Negative Freebids_ (Weak, 10- points, not forcing), with stronger hands we Rdbl first.

After an interference

1. 2 level bids in new suits are 10+ points and show 5 cards (not 4).
2. 3 level bids in new suit GF.

Examples :

1. 1♠-(2♣)-2♦ (5 ♦s, 10+ points).
2. 1♠-(2♥)-3♣ (5 ♣s, game forcing)
3. 1♦-(1♥)-1♠ (5 ♠s, 6+ points. With 4 ♠ s, bid Neg. X)
4. 1♣-(1♦)-1♠/1♥( 4 cards, X shows 4-4 in majors)
5. 1♣-(1♥)-1♠( 5 cards, neg. X shows 4 ♠)

_Negative Freebids_ (weak, <10 points) also show 5 cards. They are applicable after opponents double, or bid NT. Examples :

1. 1♥-(X)-1♠ (5♠, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
2. 1♥-(X)-2♣ (5♠, <10 points. With more than 10 points we Rdbl).
3. (1♦)-1♠-(P)-2♣ (_Positive Freebid_, 10+ points 5♣).
4. (1♦)-1♠-1NT-2♣ (_negative Freebid_, <10 points, 5♣)

#### Two suiters

We are currently playing the _**Minimax Style**_: With 11-15 HCP open the **higher** suit. Responder assumes the weaker hand. Opener must bid again with the stronger hand.

**U2NT**

Shows 2 lowest unbid suits

* 1♥-(2NT):♦ and ♣
* 1♠-(2NT): ♦ and ♣
* 1♣-(2NT) ♦ and ♥
* 1♦-(2NT) ♥ and ♣

**Extended Michaels**

Highest and another Lower suit

* 1♥-(2♥)- ♠ and minor
* 1♠-(2♠)- ♥ and minor
* 1♦-(2♦)- ♠ and ♥/♦
* 1♣-(2♣)- ♠ and ♥/♦

**Leaping and non-leaping Michaels**

Extend Michaels' philosophy to over calls of weak 2 and weak 3 bids

(2♠/♥)-?

* 4♣/♦(jump bid): min 5-5 cards ♣/♦ with ♥/♠\
  (2♦)-?

#### Defence against 2 suiters

The basic philosophy is [Lower-Lower](http://kwbridge.com/bb/b\_unus.htm). The same system can be used when our 1NT is interferred with 2-suited bids. But wecome back to it later

**Both Suits are Known**

1♥-(2NT)-? :

* Their Lower suit is a raise of our lower suit and vice versa:
* 3♣ shows limit raise or better in ♥
* 3♦ shows GF raise with 5+ ♠s
* 3♥ preempt
* 3♠ 6+ cards, <10/11 pts
* 4♦/ 4♣ splinter.

**Only 1 suit is known**

1♥-(2♥ showing ♠ and minor)-?

* 2♠ : limit raise or better in hearts.
* X : 10 + points no fit in openers suit

The idea here is to wait for opponents to find their second suit. After the opponents bid, the Xer rebids as follows :

* X : for penalty
* 3NT : game forcing, promises stoppers in known suits
* cuebid in any of the opponents suit: game forcing, stopper _asking_
* 3♥: hearts with preemptive quality, weaker than limit raise
* 4♣/4♦/3♠: splinter type bids

### Lebensohls

#### When Opponents interfere with our 1NT opening

This is the standard situation for Lebensohl, almost all other situations "derive" from it.

When the opener's 1NT is interfered with. 1NT-(2♠)-? . The problem is that the responder has no space to show his possible range of hands, or whether he holds stoppers. Lebensohl creates extra space with the 2NT-3♣ relay. Depending on the interference and the responder's suit, the relay can create 3 levels of bids, or 2. We are playing the _FASS_ (Fast arrival shows stoppers) version, or _slow denies, fast shows_ version, which contrasts the more popular _slow shows_ version.

_Example with 3 levels_, weak, invit and GF

* 1NT-(2♥)-2♠ (5/6 ♠, want to sign off)
* 1NT-(2♥)-2NT-3♣-3♠ (5/6 ♠, invitational )
* 1NT-(2♥)-3♠ (5/6 ♠ game forcing)

_Example with 2 levels, no invitational sequence_:

* 1NT-(2♠)-2NT-3♥ (♥, want to sign off)
* 1NT-(2♠)-3♥ (♥, game force)

_Stronger Hands, stopper showing (slow denies, fast shows)_

* 1NT-(2♠)-3NT (game force, ♠ stopper FASS)
* 1NT-(2♠)-2NT-3♣-3NT (game force, no ♠ stopper, FASS)

_Other Major, "Stayman in the other major"_

* 1NT-(2♠)-3♠ (game force, 4♥, ♠ stopper, FASS)
* 1NT-(2♠)-2NT-3♣-3♠ (game force, no ♠ stopper, FASS)

#### When partner doubles their weak TWO

This situation is similar to the case after 1NT, but after a takeout double the partner _must_ always bid, and _PASS_ is not available. So when only 2 levels of bids are available, the direct 3 level bid is **not GF**, but often only invitational. For GF bids, one must either use 3NT or the cuebid-Stayman.

_Examples when 3 levels of bids are available_

* 2♥-(x)-2♠ (weak)
* 2♥-(x)-2NT-3♣-3♠ (invit)
* 2♥-(x)- 3♠ (GF)

_Examples when 2 levels of bids are available_

* 2♠-2NT-3♣-3♦ (weak, could be 0 points, instead of invit)
* 2♠-3♦ (invit, 8/9+, instead of GF)

The cuebid-stayman and 3NT bids are game-forcing, as after 1NT, employing FASS as usual

#### After a simple reverse

Simple reverse: 1♦-1♠-2♥

* 2NT( Lebensohl), weak. < 8 pts, relay to 3♣
  * Any other bid (disobeying the relay) shows GF from the opener
* Any other bid by the responder is 1RF. 1♦-1♠-2♥-2♠ usually shows 6 ♠, opener cannot pass. 3 level bids (instead of Leb 2NT) are GF

### Strong 2 ♣ opening

* Standard 2♣, 22+ points or 9-ish tricks
* There are **only two non-forcing** sequences:
  1. 2♣-2♦-2NT (shows 22-23/24 pts)
  2. Responder bids cheapest new suit at 3 level called a _second negative_
     1. 2♣-2♦-2♠-3♣ (2nd neg)-3♠
     2. 2♣-2♦-3♦-3♥(2nd neg)-4♦
     3. 2♣-2♦-2♠-3♣-3♠-4♣ (responder rebids 2nd neg. suit to say he has real ♣)

[Kokish Relay](https://www.bridgewebs.com/nkbc/Kokish.pdf) (KR)

Like all relays, it creates space. The usual pattern of Kokish Relay is 2♣-2♦-2♥-2♠, with the 2♥-2♠ known as the Kokish relay

* Balanced Hands
  1. Strong Balanced hand: 2♣-2♦-2♥-2♠-2NT (24/25+ pts)
  2. Weak Balanced hand: 2♣-2♦-2NT (22-23/24 pts)
* Real hearts
  1. 2♣-2♦-2♥-2♠-3♥ (6 hearts single suiter)
  2. with 5-3-3-2 and 5 hearts, bid NT (as usual)
* Two suiters with hearts
  1. 2♣-2♦-2♥-2♠-3♣ (double suiter, hearts and ♣, 5-4 or better)
* Two suiters with spades (later)
* Unassigned sequence: 2♣-2♦-3♥ (without relay)

### Opponents don't play standard systems

#### Precision 2♣ opening

> Treat as **natural**.

### Slam Bidding Agreements

Presently we play RKC 1430 with King Ask showing specific kings. Future Improvements:

* Minorwood
* Kickback
* Exclusion Keycard
* Standard void showing responses.
* Kantar's book

### Scoring techniques matter!

Read [IMPs vs MPs](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/\~belk/impmp.htm) before every tournament!

### SOS redouble

> This is essential to rescue from penalty dbl.

Consider the following,\
(1♦)-2♣-(Pass)-Pass\
(Dbl)-Pass-(Pass\*)-?\
(\*) Making the Dbl to penalty.\
And you have the hand ♠ Q8543♥Kj954♣3♦54, would you pass at this situation?\
**No!** You should _**Rdbl**_ to tell the partner bid any _**unbid**_ suit.

**Two conditions should be followed to use SOS Rdbl.**

* Support at least 4-4 cards in unbid suit.
* Lack of support partner's suit.
* SOS Rdbl is up to 3 levels!

1. We can find some examples in [bridgebum](https://www.bridgebum.com/sos\_redouble.php).
2. (Write whatever you like from the "considerations" section of Bridgebum)

### Run after opponents double 1NT

#### Moscow Escapes

If opponents dbl after your(partner) 1NT as penalty(i.e, 15+ HCP), I hardly have 10 HCP. So, we have only (1) transfer(most frequent) or (2) stayman(no so frequent).

1NT-(X)-?

* Pass, to play
* XX, single suiter, opener bids 2♣
* 2♣, ♣ and higher
* 2♦, ♦ and higher
* 2♥, ♥ and ♠
* 2♠, 5+ ♠s weaker than XX

### Rules of thumb

#### Rule of 20

> Guideline for opening bid less than 12 HCP. Count the total HCP and then add the total number of cards of longest suits, if the value is equal to or more than 20 then open at 1 level.

#### Restricted play
