### Nebulous bids

#### [Lawrence and Bergen styles in 2/1](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/bw-21-shape-and-strength-system-summaries/)

What are the two different styles, really:

 1. Lawrence (strength) style: 
    - 1!s-2!c-2NT is a stopper rich.
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d and 1!s-2!c-2!h shows 4+ card suit
    - all other hands bid the waiting 1!s-2!c-2!s. 
    - 2!s is a *nebulous* bid:  6 card spades + all other 5 card spade hands without stoppers in unbid suits.
    - 1!h-2!c-2!s (reverse) shows extras. Without extras, opener rebids 2!h (waiting) and waits for responser to bid his 4 card spades if she has them.
    - disadvantage: difficult to distinguish 6 and 5 card opener

 2. Bergen (shape) style: 
    - 1!s-2!c-2!s promises 6 cards.
    - 1!s-2!c-2NT contains all other balanced hands with or without stoppers
    - 2NT is the *nebulous* bid: contains all balanced hands with or without stoppers.
    - without a balanced hand and 5 card spades, opener must bid his 4 card suit with or without values.
    - 1!h-2!c-2!s shows 4 spades with no extras.

 3. [Schuler style]() :
    - 1!s-2!c-2!s denies 6 cards (lying allowed), includes all other hands.
    - 2!s is *nebulous*: 5 card !s hands with or without stoppers. 
    - 1!s-2!c-2NT shows 6 !s
    - The nebulous Schuler 2!s groups 1) all Lawrence style 2!s hands without 6 cards , and Lawrence style 2NT hands, whereas the 6 card spades go to 2NT

#### Nebulous 2 bids for better 2/1 bids:

Another desirable thing would be to have 2/1 suits be 5 cards. So we introduce another nebulous bid.

*Nebulous* 2!c : Real 5+ clubs  and all other balanced hands without 5 card !d/!h.

One can design different follow ups, among them the simpler ones being the natural [Gumpertz](http://bridgewinners.com/article/view/better-21-bidding-the-nebulous-2c-bid/) and the artificial (but perhaps simpler) [Spear](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/spear-them/). 

 1. Nebulous 2!c
    - 1!s-2!d shows 5+ diamonds
    - 1!s-2!h shows 5+ hearts
    - 1!s-2!c *nebulous* : all other balanced GF hands or GF hands with real 5+ !c (all GF hands, basically)
 
 2. Responses to Nebulous 2!c 
    - 1!s-2!c-2!h : 4+ cards (std)
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d : nebulous (waiting, all other hands) or real !d 
    - 1!s-2!c-2!s : 6 card spades
    - 1!s-2!c-2NT : 18-19 pts, 12-14 goes through nebulous (or we could make it Lawrence style 2NT)
    - 1!h-2!c-2!s: no extras, 4 spades
    - Jumps to three level show shape from opener when possible:
       - 1!s-2!c-3!d, splinter for !d with 4+ !c, 5-1-2-4 or 5-0-3-5
       - 1!s-2!c-3!h, splinter for !h with 4+ !c, 5-2-1-4 or 5-3-0-5
 
 3. Responses to the waiting 2!d: 1!s-2!c-2!d-? Bidding is natural except 2oM showing real clubs.
    - 1!s-2!c-2!d-2!h(other major) showing real clubs
    - 1!h-2!c-2!d-2!s(other major) showing real clubs
 
 4. Simple Schuler extensions
    - 1!s-2!d-2!s (nebulous)
    - 1!s-2!d-2NT (6 !s, as in Schuler)
    - 1!s-2!h-2!s (nebulous)
    - 1!s-2!h-2NT (6 !s, as in Schuler)
    - 1!h-2!d-2!h (nebulous)
    - 1!h-2!d-2NT (6+ card, as in Schuler)
 
 5. Schuler extensions: Openers cheapest suit can be nebulous, to distinguish between 5 and 6 card suits.
    - 1!s-2!d-2!h(nebulous, might have !h,  to be shown later)
    - 1!s-2!d-2!s(6 cards)
    - 1!s-2!d-2NT(18-19, because 12-14 goes through nebulous)
    - 1!s-2!h-2!s (nebulous)
    - 1!s-2!h-2NT (6 !s, as in Schuler)
    - 1!h-2!d-2!h (nebulous)
    - 1!h-2!d-2NT (6+ card, as in Schuler)
