# Types of Game-forcing auctions

## Summary of agreements

- 1M-2NT Jacoby with 4+ trumps (rarely 3 with HHx). Follows Larry Cohen style MSDLB structure. Responder is the captain
- 1M-2♣ nebulous  (5+ clubs or balanced, can have 3supp in M). 
- 1♠-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/<span style="color:red;">♥</span>  and 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (5+ in 2/1 suit, can have 3supp)
  - after 2/1 non-nebulous, 2M is waiting, reverses show 15+, Schuler ON ( 2NT is 6+M)
  - after 2/1 nebulous ♣,  2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> is waiting, 2-level reverses OFF (3-level ON), Schuler OFF, ( 2M is 6+, 2NT is stopper rich with 18-19)
- Picture bid hands ( solid 2/1 suit (max 1 loser)  and  4 or HHx in trumps, no side suit ccontrols) start with 2/1 and then jump bidding the Major suit.  Responder paints a picture of his hand, and opener is the captain
- When no picture bids have been made but M-fit has been established, jump to 3NT is mild slam try, cuebidding is serious slam interest, direct 4M is no slam interest
- Splinters, only for 9-14 pt hands.  Unspecified weak splinters use *Swtich principle*
- Short suit Game tries use the same *switch principle*
- 3NT-searching auctions  followed by 2-level stopper showing, 3-level stopperasking. 
- 3NT-searching  auctions are Minor suit auctions 1m-2m or 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♣, or 1NT-2NT-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>, 1NT-2♠-3♣
- 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span> is invitational, 6+ good hearts


## Important possibilites for system change
  - abolish Bergen and make 1NT-3♣ and 1NT-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> invitational with 6 cards. Then the invitations go to J2NT: 1M-2Nt-3♣-3M shows LR with 4
  - abolish reverses after 2/1 completely. 1M-2x-2M always shows 6. 2NT shows 5-3-3-2, but not with bad doubleton in opponents suit. Minor suit raises are 3 cards.
  - 1M-(x)-2M is a bad raise(5-8) and 1M-(x)-2♣ is a good raise (8-10)
   


# Detailed Agreements
  

## 2/1 agreements 
  - 1M-2NT shows 4+ cards, GF. These are hands where responder assumes captaincy
  - Splinters show 4+ support, but only (9)10-14 pts
  - 1M-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> and 1M-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> shows 5+ cards 
  - 1M-2♣ shows other GF hands--- either real clubs (5+) or other balanced GF hands

### 1M-2♣ auctions
  - 1M-2♣-2M shows 6+ cards
  - 1M-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> is a waiting bid
  - 1M-2♣-2NT is 18-19 pts, with stops

  - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♣-2♠ *does not show extras--- not a reverse*. Spades can be skipped to force to game with 2♣.
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3♣ is a ``high reverse", shows extras (15+ or  5-5 shape).

### Summary of "artifical" sequences with nebulous
  - 1M-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span> is waiting
  - 1M-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2oM is real clubs (5+)
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♣-2♠ is not a reverse.

### Other major 2/1 auctions
   - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span> is waiting (can be 6 if opener really doesn't want to grab NT)
   - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2NT shows 6 hearts (Schuler) *Schuler only in natural auctions, not after nebulous clubs*.
   - 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♠ is a *moderate* reverse (15+)


### Opener's jump shifts after 2/1 are splinters, 
  - openers jump shifts are always splinters, including nebulous
  - 1M-2♣-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> is diamond shortness with club support, doesn't show extras
  - 1M-2♣-2<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-3 <span style="color:red;">♥</span> also splinter with <span style="color:red;">♦</span> support (and ♣)

### minor 2/1 : Inverted Minors and 1 diamond-2 clubs have similar structure
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♣ denies 4+M. (not ideal, but let us go with it now.)
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♣-2M generally shows stoppers, trying for NT
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♣-2NT shows both majors stopped
  - 1<span style="color:red;">♦</span>-2♣-3NT shows 18-19 pts, solid hand (No fast arrival in NT)
  - 3 level bids are stopper asking
  - same after inverted minors raise (1m-2m)
  - 2 level shows, 3 level asks ---- usually when we are trying for 3NT
  - 3 level asks in NT auctions after a minor suit transfer has been made.


##  Splinters and Game tries 

### Splinters 
  - 1♠-3NT is s unspec splinter, 1♠-4♣/4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>/4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> are strong splinters (12-14)
  - *Switch Principle* : 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠ is a unspec splinter, 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-3NT is a spade splinter, 4♣-4<span style="color:red;">♦</span> are club and diamond splinters.
  - After unspec splinter, next step asks, LMH replies
### Switch Principle in 2-way Game tries
  - after a major suit fit, such as 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>, or 1x-1M-2M, we pay 2-way game tries
  -  1♠-2♠-2NT shows SSGT (short suit game try), 1s-2s-3x is a HSGT. After SSGT, relay and LMH responses.
  -  *Switch Principle*: 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♠ is shortness, 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2NT is spades help suit gt, 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-3♣/3<span style="color:red;">♦</span> are helpg suit game tries. LMH responses after SSGT
  



## Jacoby 2NT: further relays
   - after J2NT, we play MSDLB responses as explained elsewhere. We make J2NT if we cannot make picture jump etc.
   - M-minimum, S- shortness, D- 5-3-2-2, L- long trumps, B- balanced 18-19
   - If first response is M, then responder can completely judge the contract with relays
   - If first response shows 15+, then non-relay bids or further relays ask responder his strength
   - E.g. : 1M-2NT-3<span style="color:red;">♦</span>(s)-3<span style="color:red;">♥</span>(relay)-4♣(spade)-4<span style="color:red;">♦</span>(further ask). In response, 4<span style="color:red;">♦</span> would show some slam interest, 4<span style="color:red;">♥</span> would show minimum, 4♠ (keycard ask) would show serious slam interest.


# Picture jumps and unserious 3NT

## Picture jumps: The most descriptive bid
   - When responder has good trumps (4+ or HHx perhaps), along with a *solid* side suit, he bids 2/1 and makes a jump in trumps later. This is a *picture jump*, after which opener can assume captaincy
   - if 2M is available, then 3M and 4M are both picture jumps. 3M shows 1 or 2 extra controls in side suits, 4M denies extra controls
   - If 2M is not available (e.g. : after 1M-2c-2M or 1<span style="color:red;">♥</span>-2♣-2♠ ), then jump to 4M by responder shows a picture bid (good trumps plus solid second suit, no side suit controls). With side suit controls, responder must bid 3M.

## Unserious 3NT
 - When playing picture jumps, opener has a 'picture' of responders hand
 - When no picture jump has been made but a major suit fit has been established, jump to 3NT is a light slam try, cuebidding is a better slam try, 4M shows  no slam interest.
